# Tile Mapper
This application is used to map tiles for custom games.
# How To Use
1. Input image files
2. Set CSV valuees (these are specific to each image and will be important for export)
3. Paint!
4. Save painted image (optionally palette too) to CSV
5. Import palette and CSV for later revision when needed
# Why?
Why make this tool? Well its because most tile mapping tools are for game engines and output specifc files. I wanted control of my mapping while making a game in Java so I made my own and decided to share it.
# Promotional
If I ever get a Patrion or somehting of the like, I will add it here to get a bit of money from my random tools and projects.
